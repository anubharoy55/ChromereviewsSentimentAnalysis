# ChromeReviewsSentimentAnalysis

There are times when a user writes Good, Nice App or any other positive text, in the review and gives 1-star rating. 
This model identifies the reviews where the semantics of review text does not match rating i.e. review text is good, but rating is negative- so that the support team can point this to users. 

It was deployed using Streamlit. The link to the same is : https://share.streamlit.io/anubharoy55/chromereviewssentimentanalysis/main/chrome.py
